    <p>
      The greatest gifts we can receive are your continuing friendship and your presence at our wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      We ask that if you would like to give us a wedding gift, that it be one which will help those with greater needs than ourselves. Below are two local St. Louis charities which mean a great deal to us. Both are 501(c)(3) non-profits and donations are tax deductable.
